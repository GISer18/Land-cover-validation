This algorithm calculates many accuracy assessment indexes, global ones like:  P0 - Overall accuracy  AUA - Average of user's accuracies  APA - Average of producer's accuracies  CSI - Classification success index  GCSI - Group classification success index  P0_marg - Overall accuracy after margfit  K - Standard (Cohen's) kappa  K_w - Weighted kappa  tau - tau index  AMI - Average mutual information  NMI_g - The geometric mean of the entropies on classified map and on reference data  NMI_m - the arithmetic mean of the maximum entropies on on classified map and on reference data  CAU - Combined user's accuracy  CAP - Combined producer's accuracy  D - Total disagreement  AD - Total allocation disagreement  QD - Total quantity disagreement  Aickin_alpha - Aickin's alpha  k_cond_aver - Average of conditional kappa  or indexes for individual class accuracy validation:  PA - Producer's accuracy  UA - User's accuracy  AUP - Average user's and producer's accuracy  ICSI - Individual Classification Success Index  MAH - Hellden's mean accuracy  MAS - Short's mapping accuracy  GT - Ground Truth Index  k_cond - Conditional kappa  qd - Quantity disagreement for each class  ad - Allocation disagreement for each class
